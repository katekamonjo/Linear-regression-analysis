# Linear-regression-analysis
Linear regression uses the relationship between data points to draw a straight line between them. It predicts the the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. 
I used Jupyter Notebook to perform the analysis.   
##Implementing linear regression in python
Import the libraries needed to create the model.
Import the insurance dataset to the notebook. 
Preprocessing. In the pre-processing I wrote codes to obtain basic information on the dataset such as data description and data shape.
Exploratory data analysis. After data pre-processing I focused on exploring the data. I examined the link between different variables using histogram(for numerical variables) and countplots(for categorical variables). 
Outlier analysis. Using boxplots, I looked for outliers. Outliers were handled using a function.
Machine learning models. I used linear regression to train my data on and get evaluation aspects in terms of MAE,RMSE and MSE.
